Unlike the other three books from the logosophistic series, Wor(l)d Religions appeals to a wider array of readers. Daniel Deleanu chooses a rational methodology, namely that exposed by Immanuel Kant in his essay Fundamental Principals of the Metaphysic of Morals. By this approach, the creator of logosophism does not intend to reduce the study of religion to a strict framework of empirical determinism, but, on the contrary, he wishes to prove that the analytical study religion should have all the attributes of science. By eliminating most of the subjective properties of world religions, which are due to the nature of the observer rather than the religions themselves, the author traces a common path of all major beliefs, leading to the most important archetype of humankind, the Word (the logoarchetype), which is associated with the Divinity in every spiritual tradition.','1469784246','9781469784243',0,'Religion',0.00,121,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JHenBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api&fife=w800','en','NOT_MATURE','BOOK'),(54,'Paradise Lost','John Milton','Không có nhà xuất bản','1754','Không có mô tả',NULL,NULL,0,'Không có thể loại',0.00,616,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GBlRAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api&fife=w800','en','NOT_MATURE','BOOK'),(55,'A Theory of Semiotics','Umberto Eco','Indiana University Press','1979','\" . . . the greatest contribution to [semiotics] since the pioneering work of C.

This controversial booklet was reviewed in several major law journals—unprecedented for a self-published work—and influenced a generation of law students and teachers. In this well-known critique, Duncan Kennedy argues that legal education reinforces class, race, and gender inequality in our society. However, Kennedy proposes a radical egalitarian alternative vision of what legal education should become, and a strategy, starting from the anarchist idea of workplace organizing, for struggle in that direction. Legal Education and the Reproduction of Hierarchy is comprehensive, covering everything about law school from the first day to moot court to job placement to life after law school. Kennedy\'s book remains one of the most cited works on American legal education. The visually striking original text is reprinted here, making it available to a new generation. The text is buttressed by commentaries by five prominent legal scholars who consider its meaning for today, as well as by an introduction and afterword by the author that describes the context in which Kennedy wrote the book, including a brief history of critical legal studies.','0814748228','9780814748220',0,'Law',0.00,231,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gDehBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api&fife=w800','en','NOT_MATURE','BOOK'),(57,'The Fate of a Man','Mikhail Aleksandrovich Sholokhov','Moscow : Progress Publishers, 1958, 1974 printing.','1962','Không có mô tả',NULL,NULL,0,'World War, 1939-1945',0.00,80,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xvgfCYuPRdgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api&fife=w800','en','NOT_MATURE','BOOK'),(58,'A Select Library of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church: The confessions and letters of St. Augustin, with a sketch of his life and work','Không có tác giả','Không có nhà xuất bản','1892','Không có mô tả',NULL,NULL,0,'Christian literature, Early',0.00,672,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lwwNAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api&fife=w800','en','NOT_MATURE','BOOK'),(59,'A Concise History of Greece','Richard Clogg','Cambridge University Press','2002-06-20','This book provides a concise, illustrated introduction to the history of modern Greece, with a new final chapter about Greek history and politics to the present day. 56 illustrations. 10 maps.','0521004799','9780521004794',4,'History',3.00,316,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=H5pyUIY4THYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api&fife=w800','en','NOT_MATURE','BOOK'),(60,'Damascus','Ross Burns','Psychology Press','2005','Lavishly illustrated, the first book in English to relate the history of Damascus, is a compelling and unique exploration of a fascinating city.','0415271053','9780415271059',0,'Damascus (Syria)',0.00,409,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SVR2cjWptCAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api&fife=w800','en','NOT_MATURE','BOOK'),(61,'Images of Nebuchadnezzar','Ronald Herbert Sack','Susquehanna University Press','2004','Images of Nebuchadnezzar attempts to probe the diversity of cultural attitudes reflected in the characterizations of this famous king through an examination of both the original cuneiform sources as well as the accounts of chronographers written in Greek, Roman, and medieval times. Included in this revised and expanded second edition are two new chapters that examine both Nebuchadnezzar\'s administrative policies and the impact that his death had on both contemporary and later cultures. Both the positive and negative images of the king are explored, with conclusions being developed as to what the authors of the various surviving accounts actually thought the king really was. In the process, the whole nature of historiography in the ancient world is analyzed, and a number of broad conclusions are developed. Anyone who has ever read Second Kings or the books of Daniel and Jeremiah of the Old Testament is familiar with the name of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon who conquered the kingdom of Judah and destroyed Solomon\'s temple. As the second member of the Chaldean dynasty of Mesopotamia (626-539 B.C.), he ruled for forty-three years (605-562 B.C.), during which time he also led military campaigns into Syria and Lebanon. He also organized a number of building projects that were to transform Babylon into one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Among his noteworthy achievements were the construction of massive fortification walls around Babylon, the refurbishing of Marduk\'s temple in the city, and the building of huge palaces that served as the king\'s residences. Tales of these legendary achievements, as well as those of his father, Nabopolassar (626-605 B.C.), also found their way into the narratives of a number of Greek, Roman, and medieval historians and chronographers many centuries later. Unfortunately, much of the record of Nebuchadnezzar\'s achievements that was written in his own time has not survived. Instead, only secondary accounts of his military campaigns or his construction projects in Babylon written in Greek, Latin, Hebrew, or Arabic are available for analysis. These stories vary greatly in content and emphasis and, in many cases, distort much of what we know from Nebuchadnezzar\'s own sources. The Hebrews, for example, described Nebuchadnezzar\'s siege of Jerusalem in such a way as to consider it something that should never again be repeated. The Greeks, on the other hand, saw the building projects in Babylon as evidence of almost superhuman achievements, as monuments that were the result of efforts by a king who was almost godlike. Why, then, is there such diversity in the characterizations of Nebuchadnezzar? This book proposes answers to these questions.','1575910799','9781575910796',0,'Biography & Autobiography',0.00,202,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nxC1wF3_IEAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api&fife=w800','en','NOT_MATURE','BOOK'),(62,'Georgina i la Dragona','Không có tác giả','Không có nhà xuất bản','Không có ngày xuất bản','Không có mô tả','8448852656','9788448852658',0,'Comics & Graphic Novels',0.00,48,'https://via.placeholder.com/150','ca','NOT_MATURE','BOOK'),(63,'Escuela de dragones 3 - El secreto de la dragona del agua','Tracey West','MOLINO','2023-01-19','¿TE APUNTAS A LA ESCUELA DE DRAGONES?
